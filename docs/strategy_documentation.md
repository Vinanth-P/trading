## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document presents a comprehensive algorithmic trading strategy designed for Indian equity markets. The strategy employs a multi-indicator momentum approach, combining Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands to identify high-probability trading opportunities while managing risk through systematic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

The strategy has been implemented with a complete backtesting framework and interactive Streamlit UI for visualization and analysis.

## 2. STRATEGY OVERVIEW & INTUITION

### 2.1 Core Philosophy

The strategy is based on momentum trading principles, seeking to capture trending price movements while avoiding false signals through multi-indicator confirmation. The approach combines:
- **Trend-following** indicators (Moving Averages, MACD)
- **Mean-reversion** indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands)

This creates a balanced trading system that can adapt to different market conditions.

### 2.2 Market Hypothesis

The strategy operates under the following assumptions:
- Markets exhibit trending behavior that can be identified and exploited
- Multiple indicator confirmation reduces false signals
- Momentum tends to persist in the short to medium term
- Systematic risk management improves long-term profitability

## 3. INDICATORS & FEATURES USED

### 3.1 Moving Averages (MA)

Simple Moving Averages identify trend direction and strength.

**Parameters:**
- Short MA: 10-period (captures short-term movements)
- Long MA: 30-period (represents longer-term trend)

**Formula:**  
`MA(n) = Sum of Close Prices over n periods / n`

**Signals:**
- Golden Cross: Short MA crosses above Long MA → Bullish
- Death Cross: Short MA crosses below Long MA → Bearish

### 3.2 Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI measures momentum and identifies overbought/oversold conditions.

**Parameters:**
- Period: 14 days
- Range: 0-100

**Interpretation:**
- RSI < 30: Oversold (potential buy)
- RSI > 70: Overbought (potential sell)
- RSI 30-70: Neutral zone (preferred for entries)

**Formula:**  
`RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))`  
where `RS = Average Gain / Average Loss over 14 periods`

### 3.3 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

MACD identifies trend changes and momentum strength.

**Parameters:**
- Fast EMA: 12 periods
- Slow EMA: 26 periods
- Signal Line: 9-period EMA of MACD

**Components:**
- MACD Line = EMA(12) - EMA(26)
- Signal Line = EMA(9) of MACD Line
- Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line

**Signals:**
- Bullish: MACD crosses above Signal line
- Bearish: MACD crosses below Signal line

### 3.4 Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands measure volatility and identify price extremes.

**Parameters:**
- Period: 20 days
- Standard Deviations: 2

**Components:**
- Middle Band = 20-period SMA
- Upper Band = Middle Band + (2 × σ)
- Lower Band = Middle Band - (2 × σ)

**Interpretation:**
- Price near lower band → Potential buy opportunity
- Price near upper band → Potential sell opportunity

### 3.5 Average True Range (ATR)

ATR measures market volatility for risk assessment.

**Formula:**  
`ATR = Average of True Range over 14 periods`  
where `True Range = max(High-Low, |High-PrevClose|, |Low-PrevClose|)`

---

## 4. ENTRY & EXIT LOGIC

### 4.1 Entry Conditions (BUY Signal)

A **BUY** signal is generated by **ANY** of the following patterns:

1. **Golden Cross with Confirmation**:
   - Short MA crosses above Long MA
   - MACD line above signal line
   
2. **Oversold Bounce**:
   - RSI < 35 and rising
   - Bullish candle (Close > Open)
   
3. **Pullback Entry in Uptrend**:
   - Price above Long MA (uptrend)
   - Short MA above Long MA
   - Price near Short MA (pullback)
   - RSI < 50 and MACD positive
   - Bullish candle confirmation
   
4. **MACD Crossover in Uptrend**:
   - Short MA > Long MA (uptrend)
   - MACD crosses above signal line
   - RSI < 60 (not overbought)

### 4.2 Exit Conditions (SELL Signal)

A position is exited when **ANY** of the following clear reversal signals occur:

1. **Death Cross**: Short MA crosses below Long MA (clear trend reversal)
2. **Overbought Reversal**: RSI > 75 and falling + bearish candle
3. **MACD Breakdown**: MACD crosses below signal in downtrend + price below Long MA
4. **Stop-Loss**: Price falls 7% below entry
5. **Take-Profit**: Price rises 15% above entry

**Note**: Sell signals require stronger confirmation than the previous version to let winners run.

### 4.3 Position Sizing

- **Position Size**: 15% of portfolio value per trade
- **Maximum Positions**: 4 concurrent positions
- **Rationale**: Improved diversification while maintaining meaningful position sizes

---

## 5. RISK MANAGEMENT RULES

### 5.1 Stop-Loss Management
- Fixed stop-loss at **7% below entry price**
- Automatically triggered to limit downside risk
- Wider stop-loss reduces whipsaws in volatile markets
- No discretionary override - systematic execution

### 5.2 Take-Profit Management
- Fixed take-profit at **15% above entry price**
- Locks in profits while allowing winners to run
- **Risk/Reward Ratio**: ~1:2 (7% risk, 15% reward)

### 5.3 Position Sizing Rules
- Maximum 15% of portfolio per position
- Maximum 4 concurrent positions (60% max deployment)
- Remaining 40% cash acts as buffer for drawdowns

### 5.4 Diversification
- Never hold more than one position in the same stock
- Positions spread across multiple sectors (when applicable)
- Reduces sector-specific risk

### 5.5 Transaction Costs
- **Cost**: 0.1% per trade (entry and exit)
- Includes brokerage, STT, and other charges
- Applied in all backtest simulations
